Application of data analytics tools for predicting the results of a biathlon sports competition

The objective was to test methods of forecasting the results of biathlon competition.

The competitive activity of highly qualified biathletes was chosen as the object of research.

The technical protocols of the races of the World Cups and the Biathlon World Championships of seasons 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 were used for the analysis («SIWIDATA»).

Jupiter Notebook is used for presenting the results of project.

Biathlon is a winter sport that combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. Men's sprint race was chosen as the analyzed discipline.

The sprint is 10 km for men. The biathlete shoots twice, once prone and once standing, for a total of 10 shots. For each miss, a penalty loop must be skied.

The biathletes start in intervals. For analysis, a race with a start in intervals is preferable, since in such races biathletes need to ski using their full force, as the results of other athletes are unknown.
